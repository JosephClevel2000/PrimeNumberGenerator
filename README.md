# PrimeNumberGenerator

WIP - Making a program to generate prime numbers for my Goldbach Conjecture program since formatting primes into a list can be a pain.
UPDATE - 1/11/2025

Wrote some code using nested while statements to create a generator. Algorithm is sloppy, i.e. it goes about checking primes the hard way but hey it seems to work! Will be using this list in the Goldbach conjecture - need to update that code at some point since the prime list can be very large now and the conjecture program slows down as the list gets bigger. Need to redesign my code somehow.
